Android home control app
...

This was an app that I made as a semester project during my years at NUST SEECS.

The short description of the system is as follows:

There is an arudino controller connected to all sorts of relays and sensors.
This controller is also connected to a bluetooth module.
The app runs on an android phone and communicates using the bluetooth module with the Arduino.
The app issues commands selected by user and hence the arduino turns on and off different things.
